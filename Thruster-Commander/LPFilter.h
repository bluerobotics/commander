Title: Blue Robotics Thruster Commander Firmware - Low-Pass Filter

Description: This code is the default firmware for the Blue Robotics
Thruster Commander, which provides a simple interface to control a
bidirectional speed controller with PWM signals. It can be used to test
motors or to control simple vehicles like a kayak.

The code is designed for the ATtiny44 microcontroller and can be compiled and
uploaded via the Arduino 1.0+ software.
